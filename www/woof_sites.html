<p>Here is a list of some WooF-powered sites:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.yousufint.com/" target="_blank">Yousuf International</a> This is a traditional searchable e-commerce application. It should be noted that this project has been running reliably without any code changes for the past 3 years.</li><li>Bernard Hodes Group's custom <a href="http://exchange.360works.com" target="_blank">Exchange</a> tool (not the mail server!) - This is a very sophisticated online tool for Bernard Hodes Group, a recruitment advertising agency, to communicate with their clients regarding advertising placements. This site is password-protected; a demo account is set up with username 'demo user' and password 'demo'. Please feel free to contact us if you would like a walk-through on many of the sophisticated behind-the-scenes features, like dynamic PDF rendering, on the fly historical currency conversion, and using multiple EOModel files to do aggregate searches from many different FileMaker systems.</li><li><a href="http://ccitl.uky.edu" target="_blank">University of Kentucky:</a> Username and password are both 'demo'. This is a system that is used to help teachers in the state of Kentucky deal with learning-disabled students. It was recently switched from FileMaker as a database to MySQL, but the WebObjects programming and the features of the site are unchanged.</li><li><a href="http://siig2.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/WebObjects/PlanetWebULP" target="_blank">University of Strasbourg</a> ( Apple did a write-up on this solution which uses WooF: here is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/fr/education/success/strasbourg/" target="_blank">original french version</a> and here is the <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.apple.com/fr/education/success/strasbourg/index2.html" target="_blank">Google translation to English</a> )</li></ul>
