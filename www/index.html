	WooF allows you to use FileMaker to be used as a data store for WebObjects. It does this with a JDBC driver written from scratch by 360Works and a JDBCPlugIn for WebObjects.
</p>
<p>
	The JDBC driver included with WooF is a general purpose JDBC driver which can be used to access FileMaker Pro from any Java process, not just WebObjects.

<h3>
	Getting support
</h3>
<p>
	The best way to ask questions about WooF is to subscribe to the <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">user mailing list</a> and ask your question there. If you post a WooF bug on the mailing list, and either get a confirmation that it is a bug or no response, then you can use the <a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue tracker</a> to record the problem.
</p>
<h3>
	Contributing to WooF
</h3>
<p>
	We welcome anybody who would like to help customize or developer WooF, or the underlying JDBC driver. <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request a role</a> in the project to participate. You can also join as an observer to get read-only access to the source code and submit issues.
</p>
<h3>
	Coding assistance/consulting
</h3>
<p>
	We make our living doing FileMaker, WebObjects, and Java development. We will be happy to work with you on either a fixed-price or hourly basis with development on your project, whether that is code-level assistance, phone support, or taking responsibility for all development.
