	360Works is very excited to finally officially release WooF7, (whose name is already out of date!), which supports FileMaker versions 6, 7, and 8. This software is free and includes source code. It includes a new JDBC driver, written from scratch by 360Works, which is faster, less buggy, and more standards-compliant than the previous JDBC driver from FileMaker. Check the <a href="https://woof.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectNewsList">announcement section</a> for a full list of new features and 'FAQs'.

	Description
</h3>
<p>
	Testing1: WooF allows you to use FileMaker to be used as a data store for WebObjects. It does this with a JDBC driver written from scratch by 360Works and a JDBCPlugIn for WebObjects.
</p>
<p>
	Testing2: The JDBC driver included with WooF is a general purpose JDBC driver which can be used to access FileMaker Pro from any Java process, not just WebObjects.
