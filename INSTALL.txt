---Install instructions (for binary downloads only)---

WooF consists of 3 separate components which each need to be placed in a specific location on your hard drive.
* Move WooF7.framework into your /Library/Frameworks/ folder
* Move the WooF_EOModelerPlugIn.EOMplugin bundle into /Developer/EOMBundles
* Move the 360Works JDBC driver for FileMaker Pro, Fmp360_JDBC.jar, into /Library/Java/Extensions

You should now be ready to start doing WebObjects and FileMaker development. Read the 'Using WooF7.html' file for information on using WooF7.

You may also want to look at the WooF_Demo folder. This contains a small working application written using WooF. For your convenience, we host the database for this sample application on our server here so that you can immediately start experimenting with WooF.
