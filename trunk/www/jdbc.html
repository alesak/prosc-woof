<h1>360Works FMPro JDBC Driver</h1>
<p>Why did we write a custom JDBC Driver?</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for auto-entered serial #'s in FileMaker Pro
</li><li>Support for dates in PreparedStatements
</li><li>Multi-threaded and streaming, which means it can retrieve an unlimited number of records without running out of memory
</li><li>Better support for container fields
</li><li>Much, much smaller (about 100K as opposed to several megabytes for driver that ships with FileMaker Server)
</li><li>More reliable, in my experience
</li><li>Includes source code
</li><li>Works through XML publishing, so does not require FMSA.
</li><li>Does not require any server plugins, permissions, or configuration other than standard XML publishing
</li><li>Supports more data types
</li><li>Better error reporting
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some downsides of our driver to be aware of compared to the FileMaker-supplied driver:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Not as fast for small record sets, updates, and inserts
</li><li>Cannot create tables and fields on the fly
</li><li>Cannot combine AND / OR searches (this is a limitation of XML gateway)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The JDBC driver is available as part of <a href="index.html">WooF</a>, download it and try it out.
