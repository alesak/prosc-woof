<p>
	WooF allows you to use FileMaker to be used as a data store for WebObjects. It does this with a JDBC driver written from scratch by 360Works and a JDBCPlugIn for WebObjects.
</p>
<p>
	The JDBC driver included with WooF is a general purpose JDBC driver which can be used to access FileMaker Pro from any Java process, not just WebObjects.
</p>
<h3>
	Getting support
</h3>
<p>
	The best way to ask questions about WooF is to subscribe to the <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">user mailing list</a> and ask your question there. If you post a WooF bug on the mailing list, and either get a confirmation that it is a bug or no response, then you can use the <a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue tracker</a> to record the problem.
</p>
<h3>WooF examples</h3>
<p>There is an example project included with the downloadable WooF files that shows how to use WebObjects with FileMaker. For your convenience, we have the JDBC URL pointing to our FileMaker server here at 360Works, so that you can immediately run the program without any time-consuming setup.</p>
<p>You can also view the <a href="woof_sites.html">WooF sites</a> list to see some examples of sites that are running with WooF.</p>
<h3>
	Contributing to WooF
