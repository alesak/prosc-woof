	360Works is very excited to finally officially release WooF7, (whose name is already out of date!), which supports FileMaker versions 6, 7, and 8. This software is free and includes source code. It includes a new JDBC driver, written from scratch by 360Works, which is faster, less buggy, and more standards-compliant than the previous JDBC driver from FileMaker. Check the <a href="/servlets/ProjectNewsList">announcement section</a> for a full list of new features and 'FAQs'.  Head to the <a href="/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Downloads</a> sections for binary downloads of the latest release.

<p>
	WooF allows you to use FileMaker to be used as a data store for WebObjects. It does this with a JDBC driver written from scratch by 360Works and a JDBCPlugIn for WebObjects.
</p>
<p>
	The JDBC driver included with WooF is a general purpose JDBC driver which can be used to access FileMaker Pro from any Java process, not just WebObjects.
</p>
<h3>
	Getting support
</h3>
<p>
	The best way to ask questions about WooF is to subscribe to the <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">user mailing list</a> and ask your question there. If you post a WooF bug on the mailing list, and either get a confirmation that it is a bug or no response, then you can use the <a href="/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue tracker</a> to record the problem.
</p>
<h3>WooF examples</h3>
<p>There is an example project included with the downloadable WooF files that shows how to use WebObjects with FileMaker. For your convenience, we have the JDBC URL pointing to our FileMaker server here at 360Works, so that you can immediately run the program without any time-consuming setup.</p>
<p>You can also view the <a href="woof_sites.html">WooF sites</a> list to see some examples of sites that are running with WooF.</p>
<h3>
	Contributing to WooF
</h3>
<p>
	We welcome anybody who would like to help customize or developer WooF, or the underlying JDBC driver. <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request a role</a> in the project to participate. You can also join as an observer to get read-only access to the source code and submit issues.
</p>
<h3>
	Coding assistance/consulting
</h3>
<p>
	We make our living doing FileMaker, WebObjects, and Java development. We will be happy to work with you on either a fixed-price or hourly basis with development on your project, whether that is code-level assistance, phone support, or taking responsibility for all development. Call us or use our <a href="http://www.360works.com/estimate_request.html">proposal request form</a> to get more information.

<h3>
	Release notes
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Revision 41: Substantial architecture change to do multi-threaded parsing. This allows returning an unlimited number of items in the ResultSet without running out of memory, since the stream is parsed on demand, and it also means that results will be returned immediately instead of having to parse the entire result first.</li>
<li>Revision 11: Fixed a problem in the ant task; it was not overwriting the old files during installation. Better error checking and reporting if the wrong version of FileMaker was specified in the URL.</li>
</ul>
</p>
